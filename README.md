Clean Architecture, MVVM, Room, LiveData,Dagger2

You can add entries to a database using room and retrieve them into a recyclerview. MVVM pattern is used with liveData.
-The app posts and retrieves Data, however, attaching the adapter in LiveData's observer prevents adapter from attaching. Still working on fixing this
